# Profit & loss checker app 

## Mark 14
This was made to build logic and practice and learn vanilla js. In this app we take the initial price of stocks, quantity of stocks bought and current
price of the stocks to check if they are making any profit or loss and by what percentage.

### The formulas used to calculate profit are:
1. (initial price - current price) * quantity of stocks
2. (Loss / initial price) * 100
3. (current price - initial price)  * quantity of stocks 
4. (Profit price / initial price) * 100
